/**
 * @deprecated QUARANTINED - Use InventoryPage from src/inventory instead
 * 
 * Quarantined: 2026-01-29
 * Reason: Renamed to "inventory" for more generic terminology
 * Replacement: frontend/src/inventory/pages/InventoryPage.tsx
 * 
 * This file is preserved per NO DELETES policy but should not be imported.
 * All imports should use: import { InventoryPage } from './inventory/pages/InventoryPage'

// Re-export from new location for backward compatibility
export { InventoryPage as WarehousePage } from '../../inventory/pages/InventoryPage';
