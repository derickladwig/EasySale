# Memory Bank Load

You are starting a new work session and need to load the memory bank context.

## Your Task

1. **Read core memory files:**
   - `memory-bank/active-state.md` (current status and priorities)
   - `memory-bank/project_brief.md` (static project context)
   - `memory-bank/system_patterns.md` (standards and gotchas)

2. **Scan recent ADRs:**
   - Check `memory-bank/adr/` directory
   - Read any ADRs relevant to today's work

3. **Summarize context:**
   - Project mission (1 sentence)
   - Current phase and focus
   - What was done last session
   - Any critical blockers or landmines
   - Top priority for today

4. **Ask for direction:**
   - "What should we work on today?"

## Output Format

```
✅ Context Loaded

Project: [Name] - [One-line mission]
Current Phase: [Phase name]
Current Focus: [What we're working toward]

Last Session:
- [Key accomplishment 1]
- [Key accomplishment 2]

⚠️ Landmines:
- [Critical thing not to forget]

📋 Top Priority: [Next action from active-state.md]

What should we tackle first?
```

## Important Notes

- Always read the actual files - never rely on memory
- If files are missing or incomplete, flag it immediately
- The validation checklist in MEMORY_SYSTEM.md must pass
- Be ready to answer questions about project context
